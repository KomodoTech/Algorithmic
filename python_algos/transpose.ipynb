    "Matrices, in computer science are most easily constructed as arrays. The simplest thing to do in our case is to just use a dynamic array where the elements are themselves dynamic arrays. This mirrors the 2D matrices we were working with above very nicely.\n",
    "\n",
    "So with that in mind, let us take care of defining a function that takes in a matrix (original) and that also returns a matrix (transposed):\n",

    "```python\n",
    "from typing import List\n",

    "class Solution:\n",
    "    def transpose(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next up, we need a place to store all the elements of our transposed matrix. As we discussed earlier, if our original matrix has <em>m</em> rows and <em>n</em> columns, then transpose has <em>n</em> rows and <em>m</em> columns. So firstly we'll need to find the number of rows and columns of our original matrix. This should do it [^1]:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    m = len(matrix)\n",
    "    n = len(matrix[0])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we need to create an empty matrix that will hold the elements of ${A^\\intercal}$. That matrix is an array with $n$ empty arrays in it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    transpose = []\n",

    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Next up, we have to iterate through our input matrix, ${A}$ and look at each element. That's somewhat non-negotiable. We need to grab each element of ${A}$ and place it into the appropriate place in ${A^\\intercal}$. That implies nested for loops:\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "What should we do inside that for loop? Well, we just want to take the current element of ${A}$ and place it into the corresponding \"slot\" in ${A^\\intercal}$. So, ideally we'd just want to write something like this:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "    for i, row in enumerate(A):\n",
    "        for j, val in enumerate(row):\n",

    "We've run into a bit of an issue here, however. `transpose` is initially holding empty arrays. You cannot simply index into them, since they are empty. There is no element at `transpose[0][0]` (as an example) initially.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to solve this issue without refactoring our code or thinking too hard, one way to do that is to simply initialize our transpose array so that it has the right shape by filling those elements with dummy data. You can do that in a few ways depending on the language:\n",
